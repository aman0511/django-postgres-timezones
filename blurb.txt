Django, Postgres, Timezones, and You

Dealing with multiple time zones can be tricky and it is easy to run into problems if you are not careful. This talk explores some of the potiential pitfalls when working with timestamps in Django and Postgres and how to deal with them.

Consider the following code:

   dt = datetime.datetime.now()
   myobj = MyDjangoModel.objects.create(timestamp=dt)
   myobj = MyDjangoModel.objects.get(pk=myobj.pk)

Would you expect that 'myobj.timestamp == dt'? With the default Django settings that is not guaranteed to be the case; come to this talk and find out why.
